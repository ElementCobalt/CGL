
# Cube

A basic demonstration that displays a rotatable cube to the screen.
Use the `W`, `S`, `A` and `D` keys on your keyboard to rotate it.

This application uses the [Tigr](https://github.com/erkkah/Tigr) library
and it's CGL wrapper, CoTigr. Find out more at [CGL on github](https://github.com/ElementCobalt/CGL).
