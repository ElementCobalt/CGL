# CGL - Cobalt Graphics Library

## Version 1.0.1

CGL is a simple, in-development 2D/3D graphics library for
use with wrappers such as [CoTigr](Source/CoTigr).

To get started, check out the [examples](Examples).

## About CGL

I made CGL because I wanted a simple utility library
for 3D graphics programming.

Yes, I know OpenGL exists but I wanted to make something
from scratch - and CGL is what I came up with.

Some basic features of CGL include:

 - Common data types used in 3D graphics programming (Vec2/Vec3 types)
 - Functions for rendering triangles
 - Functions for rendering planes
 - Functions for rotating 3D vertices

and I hope to add many more features in the future!

Another thing about CGL is that it can't be used on it's own - that
wasn't my intention. I wanted a flexible helper library that could be
used with other libraries that *can* manage window contexts and such.

## Stuff to check out

Please check out the [tigr](https://github.com/erkkah/Tigr)
library, for CGL wouldn't be possible without it!

I'm currently working on a wrapper for the SDL library
called CoSDL - keep checking in for updates!
